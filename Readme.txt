This was my first programming game made using Python and Pygame.
It's a tower defense game with the neat option of being able to create a customized track that the "enemies" will follow.
Before being able to run the program, please ensure you have Python, Pygame and Python Imaging Library installed on your computer.

At some point I should leave an option to disable to background generation and just have the choice to use an existing map

Finally, please run Menu.py, to start the game.
